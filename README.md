# Matplotlib Tutorial
This tutorial covers the basics of MatPlotLib that will allow you to start creating your own graphs. Some of the topics that I cover are:   
* Graph Labeling
* Graph Customization 
* Graph Manipulation 
* Some tips and tricks along the way! 

I used Jupyter Notebook so that it's easy to see the resulting graphs everytime we change the code around.
